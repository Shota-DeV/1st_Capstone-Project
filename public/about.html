<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm someone who enjoys exploring both the digital and physical worlds. With a strong interest in coding and technology, I love diving into new tools, learning how systems work, and building things that solve problems. When I’m not behind a screen, you’ll probably find me in the kitchen — I find cooking to be both a creative outlet and a way to unwind.</p>
